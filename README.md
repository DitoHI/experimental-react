#### Road Map Note :
##### Redux
1. Create store which includes Reducer, State, and Middleware
2. State is the constant value to define the value in Store
3. Inside reducer define specified action to modify the state
4. Inside the component, map the states to props to make the redux reducer to be accessible inside Props inside Component
